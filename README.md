# CP-PAW code package

See https://cppaw.org for further information (Currently, the
description on https://cppaw.org refers to an older release and does
not apply to the present implementation.)


# Configuration and Installation instructions


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The installation instructions are for the current version of the CP-PAW code. The instructions may not be applicable to older versions of the code. Installation process is under current development. Please report any issues to the developers.

## Requirements

- fortran compiler (e.g. gfortran, ifort)
- pkg-config, latexmk, GNU Make (version 4.3 or later)
- bash, cpp, ar
- tex (latex) distribution (e.g. TeX Live) 
- LAPACK, BLAS, FFTW3, MPI (optional), LIBXC (optional)
- tools: xmgrace, gnuplot, avogadro1

## Installation

1. Download the cppaw distribution from [Github](https://github.com/cp-paw/cp-paw).
2. Unpack the distribution in a directory. I will refer to this directory as the base directory.
3. Add the following lines to your profile (e.g. ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile). Replace the definition of `PAWDIR` by the name of the base directory.
   ```
   export PAWDIR="path to your cppaw distribution"
   export PATH=${PAWDIR}/bin/fast:${PAWDIR}/bin/fast_parallel:{PAWDIR}/bin/dbg:${PATH}
   ```
4. Execute the following commands in the base directory:
   ```
   ./paw_install
   ```
5. If this does not work, the defaults in the parmfile may not be suitable for your system. In this case, copy the default parmfile to the base directory and edit it.
   ```
   cp src/Buildtools/defaultparmfile ./parmfile
   ```
6. After editing the parmfile open `paw_install` and add `-f parmfile` as argument for `paw_build.sh`:
   ```
   src/Buildtools/paw_build.sh -f parmfile -c fast 
   src/Buildtools/paw_build.sh -f parmfile -c fast_parallel
   ```
7. Consult the manual `doc/manual.pdf` for further information.
