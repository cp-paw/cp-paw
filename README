CP-PAW code package
====================

See https://cppaw.org for further information (Currently, the
description on https://cppaw.org refers to a release and does not
apply to the present implementation.)


Configuration and Installation instructions
===========================================

1) Preconditions

- fortran compiler (e.g. gfortran)
- bash, make (GNU Make, version 4.3 or later), cpp, ar, latexmk
- A tex (latex) distribution (e.g. TeX Live) 
- libraries: LAPACK, BLAS, FFTW3, MPI (optional), LIBXC
  
For the tools, we also use xmgrace, gnuplot, avogadro1

2) Installation

- Download the cppaw distribution from Github.  

- Unpack the distribution in a directory. I will refer to this
  directory as the CPPAW directory (or base directory)

- add the following lines to your profile (e.g. ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc,
  ~/.profile)

export PAWDIR="path to your cppaw distribution"
export PATH=${PAWDIR}/bin/fast:${PAWDIR}/bin/fast_parallel:${PAWDIR}/bin/dbg:${PATH}

- enter the cppaw directory and type

./paw_install

- if this does not work, make a copy of the default parmfile

cp src/Buildtools/defaultparmfile ./parmfile

After editing the parmfile open paw\_install and add "-f parmfile" as
argumnent for paw_build.sh, such as

src/Buildtools/paw_build.sh -f parmfile -c fast 
src/Buildtools/paw_build.sh -f parmfile -c fast_parallel

- consult the manual doc/manual.pdf for further information.
