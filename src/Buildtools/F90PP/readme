f90pp.in will be converted by the configure file used as f90pp The
configure file defines a number of variables and places f90pp into the
binary directory BINDIR.

The fortran preprocessor f90pp does the following

1) it expands bloechl-templates in paw_mpelib.f90,
   paw_constraints.f90, paw_fft.f90, paw_linkedlist.f90

     #TEMPLATE NAME
       Rules
     #BODY
       code with keywords 
     #END TEMPLATE

2) with f90pp.sed it makes a number of string conversions

   -- it converts c-processor directived "#if defined", etc. to
      lowercase

   -- it converts dollar signs ($) into double underscore (__). This
      avoids the compiler option -fdollar-ok. The dollar sings in
      openmp directives "!$omp" are restored.

   -- it converts the include file names to lowercase fftw_f77.i,
      fftw3.f03, mpif.h
   
3) It uses the executable of f90pp_tmplts.f90, if it exists and
   regenerates it if it does not or if it is older than the source.
