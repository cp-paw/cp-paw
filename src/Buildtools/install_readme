The initialization is triggered by paw_install in the top directory of
the installation. 

paw_install calls paw_build.sh for each of the installation
  (dbg,fast,fast_parallel)


performs the following steps:

-- execute parameter file "source ${PARMFILE}". The default
  parmfile is src/Buildtools/defaultparmfile

-- paw_mkbuilddir.sh to fill build directory

-- construct \url{${BUILDDIR}/etc/parms.in_use} 

-- paw_mkbuilddir.sh fills build directory

-- adapt makedocs.in and place in ${BUILDDIR}/doc/Makefile. Execute it
  to construct documentation.

-- construct ${BUILDDIR}/Makefile from Makefile.in

-- execute "make prepare" in ${BUILDDIR}. This does preparation work,
   explores all dependencies (including module files) and produces a
   new make file big.mk. This make file is executed to construct
   the object files. A final call make all constructs the executable.

-- construct install.mk from \url{${BASEDIR}/src/Buildtools/makeinstall.in}
   to copy the files into the final directories
