%==========================================================================
\subsection{28.Dec.06}

The Brillouin zone integration has been reworked substantially. 

The k-point grid can now be determined by a real space cutoff specified with
\verb+!STUCTURE!kPOINT:R+. This value specifies how fine the k-point grid is
chosen. The k-point grid corresponds to a supercell chosen so large that
real space points related by translational symmetry are separated at least by
the real space cutoff. 

Using the option \verb+STRUCTURE!KPOINTS:SHIFT+, the Monkhorst-Pack k-point
grid can now be shifted away from the $\Gamma$-point. Apparently this shift
improves the k-point convergence substantially. A shift of (1,1,1) is
recommended for crystals. The option may also improve the convergence with
cell-size for isolated molecules. However that needs to be tested.

In the block \verb+!CONTROL!MERMIN+ the option of quasi-adiabatic treatment of
the occupations is provided. A new set of energy levels is introduced that
approaches the Kohn Sham levels in a retarded fashion. The occupations are
optimized in each time step for this set of occupations. This option is
recommended for static calculations. It does not lead to an energy conserving
dynamics, because it is not a true adiabatic implementation.

As one of the quasi-adiabatic options the improved tetrahedron
method\cite{bloechl94_prb49_16223} has been included. Unlike the Mermin
functional\cite{mermin65_pr137_A1441}, this method does not require finite
temperatures. It is the recommended method for static calculations of metals.

In the printout the occupations are compared with those obtained from the
current energy eigenvalues. An estimate for the error in the energy is given
together with the maximum deviation of the occupations. 

\subsection{Jan. 11, 2007}

LDA+U option of Christian Walther implemented into main code. Some changes
have been made in this course. therefore testing will be required.

\subsection{Jan. 30, 2007}

COSMO can write an input file for COSMOTHERM.

\subsection{Feb. 25, 2007}

Rewrite of the linear algebra routines in paw\_library.f90. Test routines have been 
included for the new routines. They are called by ``call lib\$test()''
Library specific driver routines are used, which distangles different libraries.
Has not been tested for ESSL library. Version has been checked into 
devel\_blo/devel version 562.

\subsection{Feb 25.2007}

change in linkedlist\$existd. If a the nth data are searched true was
only returned, if nth was the total number NUM of data in the list. It has
been changed so, that the number NUM of elements in the list must be equal
or larger than nth.

\subsection{Apr 12. 2007}

The approximate hybrid functional has been included into the ldaplusu object.

\subsection{Apr 14. 2007}

Bugfix for plotting electrostatic potential. Symptom: The potential oscillated strongly.
Cause: POTSHIFT, an additive shift for the potential was added to all Fourier components 
of the potential instead of its real space values.

\subsection{Apr 14. 2007}

Bugfix in paw\_library.f90. plans for fftw calls are now specified as integer(8). 
(integer(4), and integer did not work and produced a ``Speicherzugriffsfehler'' in the
 three dimensional fourier transform.)

\subsection{Apr 14. 2007}

Included tool paw\_1davpot.x located in src/Tools/Wave. It uses the .wv
file produced by the !control!analyse!potential option and produces
the one-dimensional potential averaged over lattice planes. This tool
can be used to determine work functions and band offsets.

\subsection{Apr 14. 2007}

Change of input parameters: 

Removed the parameter !control!dft!lda+u. Now the program decides
based only on the presence of a corresponding block in
!structure!species.

\subsection{Apr 16. 2007}

Included tool paw\_cmcwave.x, that converts a wave function output file
of the siumulation code into a cmcv format for crymolcad. It is
located in src/Tools/Wave.

\subsection{Apr 24. 2007}

Linkedlist allows for tabs in the input files. Tabs are replaced by
spaces. (includes also occurances in text strings.) 

\subsection{May 1,  2007}

Bugfix in paw\_ldaplusu. For non-collinear calculations, 
the hybrid functional and LDA+U did not apply the correction to the potential. 
Problem has been fixed in paw\_ldaplusu in routine ldaplusu\_spindenmat. 

\subsection{May 1,  2007}

Tesselation files tess\_32 tess\_122, tess\_482, tess\_1922 for COSMO
calculations have been included in the directory ``parameters''.

\subsection{May 3,  2007}

Bugfix in paw\_linkedlist.f90: With the ifc91 compiler buffer\$read did
not read all strings properly. The origin was that an substring
character array with assumed shape and assumed len parameter has been
passed to linkedlist\$set.  The problem may be a compiler problem or a
violation of the fortran standard. New routines
linkedlist\_setchr1withlength and linkedlist\_getchr1withlength have
been created, that pass the length of the array explicitely. This may
also solve the problems we had with the xlf compiler, for which a
workaround has been implemented. It needs to be checked if the present
fix also makes the xlf-workaround superfluous.

\subsection{May 5,  2007}

configure scripts changed. configure.in has been replaced by
configure.ac, the default input for autoconf. Makefile.in has been
changed a little. The changes affect the parameters in parmfiles. The
old parmfiles have been placed temporarily in the directory
oldparmfiles.

the new configure process also creates a version (paw\_prof.x) for
profiling. Create it with ``make prof''.

\subsection{May 5,  2007}

The preopt tool did not work after the amber forcefield had been
implemented as optional force field in addition to the UFF force
field. The forcefied UFF was now explicitely set in the preopt tool
and introduced as default for the classical object.

\subsection{May 13,  2007}

Change of configuration procedure.
\begin{itemize}
\item configure.ac has been simplified. Obsolete autoconf features removed.
\item configure must be used with --with-parmfile=. No other variables
  are allowed.
\item Makefile.in has been split into Makefile\_targets.in and
  Makefile.in. Configure uses Makefile\_targets.in to create Makefile
  in the PAW root directory. This Makefile contains all targets the
  user can acess directly. Makefile.in is used to create Makefile and
  Makefile\_parallel in the Object directries bin/\$ARCH/none,
  bin/\$ARCH/fast, bin/\$ARCH/dbg, bin/\$ARCH/prof.
\item instead of mpif.h, now the mpif.f90 is used. (the latter creates
  a module ``MPI'', that is used by the other routines.)
\item parallel compilation allowed for none,fast,dbg,prof.
\item processed fortran files remain in the object directories.
\item there is a function ``make clean'' which removes the files in
  bin/\$ARCH/none, bin/\$ARCH/fast, bin/\$ARCH/dbg, bin/\$ARCH/prof.
  In addition it removes all files from the doc directory except the
  tex files.
\item there are new parameters for the parmfiles and other ones have
  been removed.
\end{itemize}
   
\subsection{May 14,  2007}

change in paw\_linkedlist.f90: xlf workaround commented out. (special
fix for xlf compiler is probably not needed any more).

\subsection{May 14,  2007}

Bugfix in paw\_occupations.f90: The variable sigma was not defined at
one place. Affects behavior of Mermin with adiabatic=false fore
spin-polarized calculations.

\subsection{May 20,  2007}

PDoS tool also writes the spin for collinear calculations.

\subsection{May 25,  2007}

Included FFTW3 interface routines in paw\_library. They are not tested
and still blocked from usage.

\subsection{May 28,  2007}

Bugfix in paw_graphics.f90. it was not possible to write the density in a parallel environment.

\subsection{May 28,  2007}

paw_trace.f90 also writes into files .trace_i. where $i$ is the
task-id in a parallel environment. This avoids that the trace
information is incomplete after a crash, because the information is
not written in time to standard output.
