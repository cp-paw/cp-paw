\subsection{28.Dec.06}

The Brillouin zone integration has been reworked substantially. 

The k-point grid can now be determined by a real space cutoff specified with
\verb+!STUCTURE!kPOINT:R+. This value specifies how fine the k-point grid is
chosen. The k-point grid corresponds to a supercell chosen so large that
real space points related by translational symmetry are separated at least by
the real space cutoff. 

Using the option \verb+STRUCTURE!KPOINTS:SHIFT+, the Monkhorst-Pack k-point
grid can now be shifted away from the $\Gamma$-point. Apparently this shift
improves the k-point convergence substantially. A shift of (1,1,1) is
recommended for crystals. The option may also improve the convergence with
cell-size for isolated molecules. However that needs to be tested.

In the block \verb+!CONTROL!MERMIN+ the option of quasi-adiabatic treatment of
the occupations is provided. A new set of energy levels is introduced that
approaches the Kohn Sham levels in a retarded fashion. The occupations are
optimized in each time step for this set of occupations. This option is
recommended for static calculations. It does not lead to an energy conserving
dynamics, because it is not a true adiabatic implementation.

As one of the quasi-adiabatic options the improved tetrahedron
method\cite{bloechl94_prb49_16223} has been included. Unlike the Mermin
functional\cite{mermin65_pr137_A1441}, this method does not require finite
temperatures. It is the recommended method for static calculations of metals.

In the printout the occupations are compared with those obtained from the
current energy eigenvalues. An estimate for the error in the energy is given
together with the maximum deviation of the occupations.
