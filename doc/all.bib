  abstract={We test several ultrasoft pseudopotentials (US-PPs) and
                  projector augmented-wave (PAW) data sets,
                  calculating the bond lengths, the atomization
                  energies and the frequencies of the vibrational
                  stretch modes of various diatomic molecules. The
                  US-PPs and the PAW data sets are constructed with
                  the same recipe and using the local density
                  approximation or the Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof
                  generalized gradient approximation for the exchange
                  and correlation energies. We study the dimers H 2 ,
                  N 2 , O 2 , F 2 , Al 2 , Si 2 , P 2 , S 2 and Cl 2
                  and several monohydrides, carbides, nitrides and
                  oxides of boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine,
                  aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine,
                  iron and nickel. We find that US-PPs and PAW data
                  sets constructed with the same parameters provide
                  almost equivalent results for the bond lengths and
                  the vibrational stretch frequencies while, for some
                  molecules, the PAW method is superior to the US-PP
                  method for the calculation of the atomization
                  energies. Our geometries and vibrational frequencies
                  are compared with the results present in the
                  literature and obtained by localized basis sets. It
                  is found that the agreement is very good, with
                  discrepancies comparable to those due to the use of
                  different localized basis sets.},

 abstract       = {An implementation of full self-consistency over the
                  electronic density in the DFT + DMFT framework on
                  the basis of a plane wave–projector augmented wave
                  (PAW) DFT code is presented. It allows for an
                  accurate calculation of the total energy in DFT +
                  DMFT within a plane wave approach. In contrast to
                  frameworks based on the maximally localized Wannier
                  function, the method is easily applied to f electron
                  systems, such as cerium, cerium oxide (Ce2O3) and
                  plutonium oxide (Pu2O3). In order to have a correct
                  and physical calculation of the energy terms, we
                  find that the calculation of the self-consistent
                  density is mandatory. The formalism is general and
                  does not depend on the method used to solve the
                  impurity model. Calculations are carried out within
                  the Hubbard I approximation, which is fast to solve,
                  and gives a good description of strongly correlated
                  insulators. We compare the DFT + DMFT and DFT + U
                  solutions, and underline the qualitative differences
                  of their converged densities. We emphasize that in
                  contrast to DFT + U, DFT + DMFT does not break the
                  spin and orbital symmetry. As a consequence, DFT +
                  DMFT implies, on top of a better physical
                  description of correlated metals and insulators, a
                  reduced occurrence of unphysical metastable
                  solutions in correlated insulators in comparison to
                  DFT + U.},

  abstract = {We propose a form for the exchange-correlation potential
                  in local-density band theory, appropriate for Mott
                  insulators. The idea is to use the
                  ‘‘constrained-local-density-approximation’’ Hubbard
                  parameter U as the quantity relating the
                  single-particle potentials to the magnetic- (and
                  orbital-) order parameters. Our energy functional is
                  that of the local-density approximation plus the
                  mean-field approximation to the remaining part of
                  the U term. We argue that such a method should make
                  sense, if one accepts the Hubbard model and the
                  success of constrained-local-density-approximation
                  parameter calculations. Using this ab initio scheme,
                  we find that all late-3d-transition-metal monoxides,
                  as well as the parent compounds of the high-Tc
                  compounds, are large-gap magnetic insulators of the
                  charge-transfer type. Further, the method predicts
                  that LiNiO2 is a low-spin ferromagnet and NiS a
                  local-moment p-type metal. The present version of
                  the scheme fails for the early-3d-transition-metal
                  monoxides and for the late 3d transition metals.},

  abstract = {We construct a functional for the single-particle
                  Green’s function, which is a variant of the standard
                  Baym-Kadanoff functional. The stability of the
                  stationary solutions to the functional is directly
                  related to aspects of the irreducible particle hole
                  interaction through the Bethe-Salpeter equation. A
                  startling aspect of this functional is that it
                  allows a simple and rigorous derivation of both the
                  standard and extended dynamical mean-field (DMFT)
                  equations as stationary conditions. Though the DMFT
                  equations were formerly obtained only in the limit
                  of infinite lattice coordination, the functional
                  described in the work presents a way of directly
                  extending DMFT to finite-dimensional systems, both
                  on a lattice and in a continuum. Instabilities of
                  the stationary solution at the bifurcation point of
                  the functional signal the appearance of a zero mode
                  at the Mott transition which then couples to
                  physical quantities resulting in divergences at the
                  transition.},

  abstract = {It was recently proposed to use variational functionals
                  based on many-body perturbation theory for the
                  calculation of the total energies of many-electron
                  systems. The accuracy of such functionals depends on
                  the degree of sophistication of the underlying
                  perturbation expansions. An older such functional
                  and a recently constructed functional, both at the
                  level of the GW approximation (GWA), were tested on
                  the electron gas with indeed very encouraging
                  results. In the present work we test the older of
                  these functionals on atoms and find correlation
                  energies much better than those of the random-phase
                  approximation but still definitely worse as compared
                  to the case of the gas. Using the recent functional
                  of two independent variables it becomes relatively
                  easy to include second-order exchange effects not
                  present in the GWA. In the atomic limit we find this
                  to be very important and the correlation energies
                  improve to an accuracy of 10–20 % when obtained from
                  calculations much less demanding than those of,

                  Normal and Superfluid Systems. I. Algebraic
                  Formulation},
  abstract = {This paper shows how the dynamical and thermodynamical
                  properties of an interacting quantum mechanical
                  system with many degrees of freedom may be expressed
                  and calculated solely in terms of renormalized
                  propagators and renormalized vertices or
                  interactions. The formulation employed is
                  sufficiently general to encompass systems which have
                  several components, with Fermi or Bose statistics,
                  whether or not they exhibit superfluidity or
                  superconductivity. The process of renormalization is
                  the functional generalization of the thermodynamic
                  transformation from the chemical potential and
                  temperature to the energy and matter densities. With
                  each set of variables (here, functions) is
                  associated a natural thermodynamic function (here a
                  functional). The natural functional for the
                  unrenormalized potentials which occur in the
                  Hamiltonian is the logarithm of the grand partition
                  function; the natural functional for the fully
                  renormalized variables, the distribution functions,
                  is the entropy. In particular, a stationarity
                  principle for a functional F(2) of distribution
                  functions subject to constraints is shown to provide
                  a fully renormalized description of the system. The
                  numerical value of this functional, at the
                  stationarity point at which the distribution
                  functions take their actual value, is the entropy of
                  the system. The equations of stationarity are
                  expressions for the unrenormalized ν‐body potentials
                  vν in terms of the ν′‐body distribution functions
                  Gν′. The functionals F(2) and vν (of the
                  distribution functions Gν′) are expressed as the
                  solutions of closed functional differential
                  equations which may be used to generate their
                  power‐series expansions. For a superfluid Bose
                  system, as for the electromagnetic field interacting
                  with matter, it is necessary to consider expectation
                  values of odd, as well as even, numbers of field
                  operators. In particular it is necessary to employ
                  the expectation values Gν for 2ν = 1, 2, 3, 4 field
                  operators. For a fermion system, even if it is
                  superconducting, only the functions Gν for 2ν = 2, 4
                  are required. In contrast to other thermodynamical
                  functionals, the entropy functional F(2) makes no
                  reference to equilibrium parameters such as
                  temperature and chemical potential.},

 title = {New Method for Calculating the One-Particle Green's Function
                  with Application to the Electron-Gas Problem},
  author = {Hedin, Lars},
  abstract = {A set of successively more accurate self-consistent
                  equations for the one-electron Green's function have
                  been derived. They correspond to an expansion in a
                  screened potential rather than the bare Coulomb
                  potential. The first equation is adequate for many
                  purposes. Each equation follows from the demand that
                  a corresponding expression for the total energy be
                  stationary with respect to variations in the Green's
                  function. The main information to be obtained,
                  besides the total energy, is one-particle-like
                  excitation spectra, i.e., spectra characterized by
                  the quantum numbers of a single particle. This
                  includes the low-excitation spectra in metals as
                  well as configurations in atoms, molecules, and
                  solids with one electron outside or one electron
                  missing from a closed-shell structure. In the latter
                  cases we obtain an approximate description by a
                  modified Hartree-Fock equation involving a "Coulomb
                  hole" and a static screened potential in the
                  exchange term. As an example, spectra of some atoms
                  are discussed. To investigate the convergence of
                  successive approximations for the Green's function,
                  extensive calculations have been made for the
                  electron gas at a range of metallic densities. The
                  results are expressed in terms of quasiparticle
                  energies E(k) and quasiparticle interactions f(k,
                  k′). The very first approximation gives a good value
                  for the magnitude of E(k). To estimate the
                  derivative of E(k) we need both the first- and the
                  second-order terms. The derivative, and thus the
                  specific heat, is found to differ from the
                  free-particle value by only a few percent. Our
                  correction to the specific heat keeps the same sign
                  down to the lowest alkali-metal densities, and is
                  smaller than those obtained recently by Silverstein
                  and by Rice. Our results for the paramagnetic
                  susceptibility are unreliable in the
                  alkali-metal-density region owing to poor
                  convergence of the expansion for f. Besides the
                  proof of a modified Luttinger-Ward-Klein variational
                  principle and a related self-consistency idea, there
                  is not much new in principle in this paper. The
                  emphasis is on the development of a numerically
                  manageable approximation scheme.},

                  frustrated Hubbard model in infinite dimensions},
  abstract = {We discuss the solution of the Mott transition problem
                  in a fully frustrated lattice with a semicircular
                  density of states in the limit of infinite
                  dimensions from the point of view of a Landau free
                  energy functional. This approach provides a simple
                  relation between the free energy of the lattice
                  model and that of its local description in terms of
                  an impurity model. The character of the Mott
                  transition in infinite dimensions, (as reviewed by
                  Georges, Kotliar, Krauth and Rozenberg,
                  Rev. Mod. Phys. 68, 13 (1996)) follows simply from
                  the form of the free energy functional and the
                  physics of quantum impurity models. At zero
                  temperature, below a critical value of the
                  interaction U, a Mott insulator with a finite gap in
                  the one particle spectrum, becomes unstable to the
                  formation of a narrow band near the Fermi
                  energy. Using the insights provided by the Landau
                  approach we answer questions raised about the
                  dynamical mean field solution of the Mott transition
                  problem, and comment on its applicability to three
                  dimensional transition metal oxides.},

  abstract = {A versatile method for combining density functional
                  theory in the local density approximation with
                  dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is
                  presented. Starting from a general basis-independent
                  formulation, we use Wannier functions as an
                  interface between the two theories. These functions
                  are used for the physical purpose of identifying the
                  correlated orbitals in a specific material, and also
                  for the more technical purpose of interfacing DMFT
                  with different kinds of band-structure methods (with
                  three different techniques being used in the present
                  work). We explore and compare two distinct Wannier
                  schemes, namely the maximally localized Wannier
                  function and the Nth order muffin-tin-orbital
                  methods. Two correlated materials with different
                  degrees of structural and electronic complexity,
                  SrVO3 and BaVS3, are investigated as case
                  studies. SrVO3 belongs to the canonical class of
                  correlated transition-metal oxides, and is chosen
                  here as a test case in view of its simple structure
                  and physical properties. In contrast, the sulfide
                  BaVS3 is known for its rich and complex physics,
                  associated with strong correlation effects and
                  low-dimensional characteristics. Insights into the
                  physics associated with the metal-insulator
                  transition of this compound are provided,
                  particularly regarding correlation-induced
                  modifications of its Fermi surface. Additionally,
                  the necessary formalism for implementing
                  self-consistency over the electronic charge density
                  in a Wannier basis is discussed.},

 abstract ={Universal variational functionals of densities,
                  first-order density matrices, and natural
                  spin-orbitals are explicitly displayed for
                  variational calculations of ground states of
                  interacting electrons in atoms, molecules, and
                  solids. In all cases, the functionals search for
                  constrained minima. In particular, following Percus
                  [Formula: see text] is identified as the universal
                  functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the
                  kinetic and electron—electron repulsion energies of
                  an N-representable trial electron density ρ. Q[ρ]
                  searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions Ψρ which
                  yield the fixed. ρ. Q[ρ] then delivers that
                  expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly,
                  [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal
                  functional for the electron—electron repulsion
                  energy of an N-representable trial first-order
                  density matrix γ, where the actual external
                  potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These
                  universal functions do not require that a trial
                  function for a variational calculation be associated
                  with a ground state of some external
                  potential. Thus, the v-representability problem,
                  which is especially severe for trial first-order
                  density matrices, has been solved. Universal
                  variational functionals in Hartree—Fock and other
                  restricted wavefunction theories are also
                  presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional
                  theory is compared with traditional orbital
                  formulations in density functional theory.},

  abstract = {The limit of infinite dimension of the Hubbard model was
                  recently introduced by Metzner and Vollhardt as a
                  new type of model with interesting implications. In
                  the present paper the same limit is applied to a
                  family of lattice fermion models with generalized
                  kinetic and potential energies. A simple method is
                  introduced for investigating the important issue of
                  handling momentum conservation at the interaction
                  vertices. It is shown that the irrelevance of
                  momentum conservation found by Metzner and Vollhardt
                  applies more generally than their Gaussian density
                  of states. Interactions between particles on
                  different sites are shown to simplify to their
                  Hartree substitute. This leaves on-site interactions
                  as the only dynamical interactions in the limit of
                  infinite dimension.},

  author = {Nevidomskyy, Andriy H. and S\'en\'echal, David and
                  Tremblay, A.-M. S.},
  abstract = {In the variational cluster approximation (VCA) (or
                  variational cluster perturbation theory), widely
                  used to study the Hubbard model, a fundamental
                  problem that renders variational solutions difficult
                  in practice is its known lack of convexity at
                  stationary points, i.e., the physical solutions can
                  be saddle points rather than extrema of the
                  self-energy functional. Here, we suggest two
                  different approaches to construct a convex
                  functional Ω[Σ]. In the first approach, one can show
                  analytically that in the approximation where the
                  irreducible particle-hole vertex depends only on
                  center of mass coordinates, the functional is convex
                  away from phase transitions in the corresponding
                  channel. Numerical tests on a tractable version of
                  that functional show that convexity can be a
                  nuisance when looking for instabilities both in the
                  pairing and particle-hole channels. Therefore, an
                  alternative phenomenological functional is
                  proposed. Convexity is explicitly enforced only with
                  respect to a restricted set of variables, such as
                  the cluster chemical potential that is known to be
                  otherwise problematic. Numerical tests show that our
                  functional is convex at the physical solutions of
                  VCA and allows second-order phase transitions in the
                  pairing channel as well. This opens the way to the
                  use of more efficient algorithms to find solutions
                  of the VCA equations.},

  abstract     = {The general expression for the exact forces on the
                  nuclei (negative derivatives of the total energy
                  with respect to the nuclear coordinates) is applied
                  for Hartree-Fock wavefunctions. It is suggested that
                  force constants should be calculated by
                  differentiating the forces numerically. This method,
                  called the force method, is numerically more
                  accurate and requires less computation than the
                  customary one of differentiating the energy
                  numerically twice. It permits the quick
                  determination of the equilibrium geometry by
                  relaxing the nuclear coordinates until the forces
                  vanish. The unreliability of the methods using the
                  Hellmann-Feynman forces is re-emphasized. The
                  question of which force constants can be best
                  calculated ab initio is discussed.},

 title = {General properties of entropy},
  author = {Wehrl, Alfred},
  abstract = {It is rather paradoxical that, although entropy is one
                  of the most important quantities in physics, its
                  main properties are rarely listed in the usual
                  textbooks on statistical mechanics. In this paper we
                  try to fill this gap by discussing these properties,
                  as, for instance, invariance, additivity, concavity,
                  subadditivity, strong subadditivity, continuity,
                  etc., in detail, with reference to their
                  implications in statistical mechanics. In addition,
                  we consider related concepts such as relative
                  entropy, skew entropy, dynamical entropy,
                  etc. Taking into account that statistical mechanics
                  deals with large, essentially infinite systems, we
                  finally will get a glimpse of systems with
                  infinitely many degrees of freedom.},
